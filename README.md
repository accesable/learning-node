# Node.js Architecture
- Single-Threaded and Non-blocking I/O
- Event loop
- Modules
- Event emitter and listener
    ## Single-Threaded
  - Event loop to handle mutiple requests
  - handle large number of concurrent requests
  - Single-threaded execution can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive tasks
  - Node.js provides ways to offload CPU-intensive tasks to other processes or threads.
